This project is a clone of [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/), a tool that allows users to create a page with links to their social media profiles, websites, and other online resources. This clone is designed to be simple, customizable, and easy to deploy.

Features
--------

*   **Customizable Link Page**: Add your own links and customize the appearance.
*   **Responsive Design**: The page adapts to different devices and screen sizes.
*   **Easy to Deploy**: You only need a static web server to host the page.
*   **Customization**: Change colors, fonts, and styles to match your brand.

How to Use
----------

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    
        git clone https://github.com/sperea/linktree-clon.git
    
2.  **Edit the links**: Open the `index.html` file and modify the links in the corresponding section. You can add or remove links as needed.
3.  **Customize the style**: If you want to change the page's style, edit the `styles.css` file in the `css` folder. Here you can modify colors, fonts, and other styles.
4.  **Upload to your server**: Once you've customized the page, upload it to your static web server (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
